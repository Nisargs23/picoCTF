# Forbidden paths

The challenge gave the us the filepath and name of the file. I checked out the website and tried to read the examples given.

Upon trying to access flag.txt directly, it says that we aren't authorised to access it.

Obviously. It wouldn't be that easy. Now the challenge already specified that the displayed files follow the path /usr/share/nginx/html/. So I would have to get to usr somehow. 

In a normal terminal, we could simply use cd, but that wouldn't work here.

I checked the page source but it was of no use. Then I googled how to go backwards in a directory, and the first search result told me that to access the parent directory, one could just put ../

The example I saw used cd, but I tried it here.

One ../ would take me to the previous directory, to get to usr, I would have to use it 4 times.

That gave the flag picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}.
