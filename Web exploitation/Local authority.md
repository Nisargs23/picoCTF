This one was pretty easy and I didn't have to look up a single thing.

So the challenge takes us to a website which asks for a username and a password, which of course we don't know.
I inputted a general username and password to see the code behind it.

The hint in the question said to how the password is checked.

On going through the code, first there was this filter for only letters and numbers, and then a bunch of conditions.

I had tho see the contents of checkPassword function, as it must be comparing the password entered to something. 

I couldn't see the function straightaway.


It was in this secure.js page <img width="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Nisargs23/picoCTF/assets/148000598/f726c36d-1816-40ae-b6be-038f8e00a2bd">

On going to the page, there was a pretty straightforward script comparing the password entered.

Upon entering the correct username and password, the flag was displayed.
