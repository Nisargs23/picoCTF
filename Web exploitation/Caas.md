# CaaS

This one was quick and fun to do.

The url provided basically gives an illustration of a cow saying whatever message we put in the url.

There was also a javascript file along with the challenge. The file had the script for this webpage.

Now I don't really know java but from what I understood, the dollar sign in the exec command means that i could also execute commands like the command prompt by putting it in the url.

Alhough it took me a few mins and some help to figure this out, and also that there would have to be a semicolon after each command.

Naturally, the first thing I tried was ls, and sure enough there was a file conveniently called falg.

That was it. It gave the flag.picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}
