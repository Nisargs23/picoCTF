# basic-mod1

In this challenge, there was a .txt file which consisted of a few numbers.

To  decode these numbers, there were specific instructions given.
The value of the numbers mod 37 would have to be mapped to the given set of characters to get the decoded message.

It was pretty straightforward and I wrote a simple python program to print the mapped out values.
I made a list for the numbers, and a string for the character set. Then I simply printed the mapped characters.
