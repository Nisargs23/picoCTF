# ARMssembly 0

Looking at the file I couldn't tell what language it was. As I am familiar with only a few.
After searching for the commands, I learned that it was arm assembly language. Which is basically a low level assembly
language for arm processors. 

Anyways , first I tried to search how I could execute the program, as that would technically give the answer, bbut the process
was very tedious and it wouldn't actually be reverse engineering if I just ran the program, would it?


So I painstakingly saw what each command from the main function was actually doing. I couldn't really understand what was going
on.
