This challenge gave the source code and allowed us to run the program.

I tried using the program it was about buying stocks. The source code was pretty long and I started to go through it.

I went through the code but couldn't find anything out of place. The hint mentioned something to do with the api key. So I checked the part of the code with the api key.

The is using a file to check the api key. We don't have access to this file.
Now I really didn't know what to do with this information and how to proceed. So I had to take alittle help to understand what was going on.

In the code we can see that when he api key is asked for, it also prints it back. 

Now in the printf statement, when a %d or %s is used, we have to provide an argument to replace these when the statement is printed. But if the number of these format specifiers exceeds the argument provided, it doesn't give an error. 

To exploit this, if we simply put an excess of these format specifiers instead of the api key, we would be able to access contents of the file holding the api key.

We also know that our flag lies in the same file too.

So I tried it.

It gave some data. Further, I used %x to get hexadecimal values. %d would only give the decimal values

Next I converted this data to ascii, and sure enough there was something that resembled a flag.

I found out this was in little endian format and would have to convert it to
