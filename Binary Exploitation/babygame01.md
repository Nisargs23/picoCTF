This challenge basically has a game that we can play and there is no source code for it.

This challenge left me completely clueless. More so than any other challenge I had done till now. 

First I manually reached the X which was the end of the game but it didn't give any kind of flag.

I had absolutely no idea what to do and hence referred to content related to the challenge. I saw the usage of ghidra in a few places and checked it out.

Ghidra is a tool for reverse engineering as it helps ananlyze the file.

After installing ghidra, I loaded the game file into it and looked around a bit

I tried looking through the code like thing for quite a while but I wasn't getting anywhere. 

There was this movement section which had these if else parameters, and in addidition to w,a,s,d there was p which would end the game. But this didn't give the flag.

I had absolutely no idea what I was looking for even the win and solve round sections didn't help

So I just painstakingly went around the map looking for the flag.I couldn't even find it like that. It wasn't on the map. It was beyond the map. I only know this beacause I had referred to other people's work.
