# Buffer Overflow 0

This challenge provided the source code, and the program. 

The name itself is buffer overflow. Which basically means that the amount of data in a buffer exceeds its limit,

Upon viewing the source code, we see this section here which prints the flag.

From what I learned by googling while solving this challenge, the function sigsegv_handler would detect if there was an overflow, and hence would print out the flag.

Overflowing the program was easy enough.
