# Getting started

I just wanted to elaborate on my experience of starting picoCTF at first.
I had solved a few ctfs before this but I have to say they were pretty basic.Like really easy compared to the stuff here. And so initially, it was quite a challenge.
The first one I tried was keygenme-py and there wasn't even any description as to what I had to do. There was just a python code. I didn't even know what I was looking for.
It got a little frustrating.

I had to get a little bit of help to get going and I felt a little better after knowing that it was normal to feel a little clueless. I looked at the problem again with more peace of mind.
And also told myself that it would take some time to solve it.
It felt pretty good after solving the first ctf. I learned that would take time and some effort to solve these.
