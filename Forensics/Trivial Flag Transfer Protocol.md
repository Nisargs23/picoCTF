# Trivial flag transfer protocol

tftp stands for trivial file transfer protocol which basically allows exchange of files between machines.

The file in this challenge was a pcapng file. This kind of file stores data about a network. This data is used to analyse the network characteristics.
To open this file, I installed wireshark. 

I followed instructions to export the tftp files.

After being exported, there were a few files, Three images and a few text files.

The first one I opened was obviously instructions. It was encrypted so I tried a few ciphers like ceasar. It was a rot13 cipher.
